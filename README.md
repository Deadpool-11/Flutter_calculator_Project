1. Addition
2. Substraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exponential calculations
6. Logarithmic Calculations
7. Trignometric Calculations

I is made using the framework by flutter. And verified its functioning on android simulator.

## List of Technologies and frameworks used
This uses multiple technologies:
1. Programming Language: Dart
2. Framework: Flutter
3. Widgets and components: MaterialApp, Scaffold, Container, Column, Row, Text, ElevatedButtons, wrap, padding, sizedBox etc
4. Libraries: math_expressions/math_expressions.dart, flutter/material.dart
5. Target and Devloper Device: Android (iOS simulator wasnt running!) and macOS respectively
6. IDE: VS code
7. simulator: from Xcode and android Studio

## Setup Instruction
I'll be writing instruction assuming the developer system is mac:
* __Install Xcode__:It is a pre-requisite for Flutter setup on your mac. You can follow https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ 
* __Install Cocoapods__:Again pre-requisite for Flutter setup. You can follow https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html
* __Install a IDE__:You'll need it for editing codes in convinience. Preferably, VScode from https://code.visualstudio.com
* __Install Android Stodio__: Basically, you will need it for android simulator on VS Code. Download it from https://developer.android.com/studio
* __Install Flutter SDK__: You have 2 methods for this-  
  * manually through Terminal
  * Directly through VS Code
     you can follow https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos
* clone the git repo, which you will simulate.
* connect a physical phone or simulate android, so that the device is visible in bottom right section of the VS code.
* click F5 while being on main.dart file inside lib. And it should start a new window in phone simulating the coded app.
